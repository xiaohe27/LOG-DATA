All properties are specified in metric first-order temporal logic
(MFOTL), or in its extension to aggregation operators and function
symbols. See [1] for a definition of MFOTL and [2] for the definition
of MFOTL's extension. 

MFOTL's models are temporal structures, that is, sequences of
timestamped first-order structures. To encode temporal structures as
event sequences, we assume that each event has two implicit
parameters, its time point and its timestamp, with the names 'tp' and
'ts', respectively. (The time point is the index of the structure in
the sequence.)

Thus, any line in a CSV formatted trace file from these benchmarks has
the form  
  p,tp=i,ts=t,f1=v1,f2=v2,...,fn=vn
where p is the event name, i is its time point, t is the timestamp of
its occurrence, and v1,...,vn are the values of its parameters.

Events that have the same time point are assumed to be
unordered. However, events with different time points are assumed to
be ordered, even if they have the same timestamps.




The traces for benchmarks (B1) to (B4) are synthetically generated.
The trace for benchmark (B5) comes from a real-world case study,
presented in [3], and which performs an analysis of data usage during
the Nokia's Lausanne Data Collection Campaign [5,6] from 2010. Nokia
kindly allowed us to make this data publicly available.


Finally, here are some statistics on the trace files:
 benchmark    file size   event rates   time span
        B1         13MB          5000          60
        B2         13MB          5000          60
        B3          2MB          1000          60
        B4         10MB          5000          60
        B5         14GB             6    36507815

The event rate is the average number of event per timestamp, while the
time span is the difference between the last and the first timestamp.
