Specification (in MFOTL)
=============

ALWAYS FORALL c, t, a. 
  trans(c,t,a) AND 2000 < a  IMPLIES  ONCE[2,21) EXISTS e. auth(e,t)


Informal explanation
====================

The property formalizes a compliance policy for a banking system that
processes customer transactions. This is property (P5) from [1].

The property requires that executed transactions t of any customer c
must be authorized by some employee e before they are executed if the
transferred money a exceeds a given threshold of $2,000.

The event trans(c,t,a) denotes that the client c performs the
transaction t, transferring the amount a. The event auth(e,t) denotes
the authorization of the transaction t by the employee e. 


Verdict
=======

The property is not satisfied. In particular, there are three
violations, namely (in MonPoly's output format [4]):

@92 (time-point 323302): (807,17368,2495)
@92 (time-point 323303): (3196,26167,2120)
@92 (time-point 323304): (2552,4409,2151)

The first one reads as follows: At timestamp 92 the transaction 17368
of the client 807 transferring the amount $2,495 does not satisfy the
requirement.
