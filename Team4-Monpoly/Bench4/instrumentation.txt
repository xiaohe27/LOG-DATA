Events 
  p(c1,...,cn) 
in the specification correspond to events 
  p,tp=i,ts=t,f1=c1,f2=c2,...,fn=cn
in the CSV formatted trace, where i is the event's time point and t is
the timestamp of the event occurrence. See the README file in the
archive's top-level directory for more details. The event tp(i) in the
specification is an exception, as it has no corresponding event in the
trace. Instead, tp(i) denotes the time point i of the current event in
the trace.

The specification event names and corresponding field names are:
  withdraw(u,a)
  


Sample trace lines:
  withdraw,tp=0,ts=1,u=u109,a=32
  withdraw,tp=0,ts=1,u=u438,a=55
  withdraw,tp=1,ts=2,u=u642,a=58
  withdraw,tp=1,ts=2,u=u530,a=8
