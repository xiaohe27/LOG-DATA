Specification (in MFOTL)
=============

ALWAYS FORALL a, f. 
 publish(a,f) IMPLIES 
  (NOT acc_F(a) SINCE[0,*) acc_S(a)) 
  AND 
  ONCE[0,10] EXISTS m. 
   (NOT mgr_F(m,a) SINCE[0,*) mgr_S(m,a)) AND approve(m,f)


Informal explanation
====================

The property represents an approval policy for publishing business
reports within a company. This is property (P3) from [1].

The property requires that any report must be approved prior to its
publication. Furthermore, the property asks that the person who
publishes the report must be an accountant and the person who approves
the publication must be the accountant’s manager. Finally, the
approval must happen within at most 10 days before the publication.

The event publish(a,f) denotes the publication of the report f by the
accountant a. The event approve(m,f) denotes the publishing approval
of the report f by the manager m. The event mgr_S (m,a) marks the time
when m starts being a’s manager and the event mgr_F (m,a) marks the
corresponding finishing time. Analogously, acc_S(a) and acc_F(a) mark
the starting and finishing times when a is an accountant.


Verdict
=======

The property is not satisfied. In particular, there are four
violations, namely (in MonPoly's output format [4]):

@91 (time-point 57347): (93,25218)
@91 (time-point 57348): (51,7848)
@91 (time-point 57350): (35,19053)
@91 (time-point 57351): (88,17294)

The first one reads as follows: At timestamp 91, the accountant 93
published the report 25218 without satisfying the approval policy.
