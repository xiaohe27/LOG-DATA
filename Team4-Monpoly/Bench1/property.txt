Specification (in MFOTL)
=============

ALWAYS FORALL c, t, a. 
  trans(c,t,a) AND 2000 < a  IMPLIES  EVENTUALLY[0,6) report(t)


Informal explanation
====================

The property formalizes a compliance policy for a banking system that
processes customer transactions. This is property (P4) from [1].

The property requires that executed transactions t of any customer c
must be reported within at most 5 days if the transferred money a
exceeds a given threshold of $2,000.

The event trans(c,t,a) denotes that the client c performs the
transaction t, transferring the amount a. The report(t) event denotes
that the transaction t is reported.


Verdict
=======

The property is not satisfied. In particular, there are two
violations, namely (in MonPoly's output format [4]):

@92 (time-point 320423): (3196,26167,2120)
@92 (time-point 320424): (2552,4409,2151)

The first one reads as follows: At timestamp 92 the transaction 26167
of the client 3196 transferring the amount $2,120 does not satisfy the
requirement.
